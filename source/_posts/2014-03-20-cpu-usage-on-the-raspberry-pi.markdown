## Sample Code
The following chunks of code contain the memory examples from µCast #14 as well as the CPU usage code in Python or NodeJS. **This code is not production ready as it does little to no error checking.**

### NodeJS Sample
{% gist sidwarkd/9578213 pi_stats.js %} 

### Python Sample
{% gist sidwarkd/9578213 pi_stats.py %}
