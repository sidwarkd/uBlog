I recently came across an instructable about [streaming temperature data to plot.ly][instr]. I wanted to go through their example setup but didn't have the same kind of temperature sensor. So I created a screencast showing how I modified their source code to use the streaming service with my [TMP102 Sensor from Sparkfun][tmp102].
