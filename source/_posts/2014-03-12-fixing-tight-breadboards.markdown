Have you ever bought a breadboard that had extremely tight connection terminals? The kind that you can't connect anything to because everything just bends. I get that breadboards need to securely hold things but not being able to easily insert a resistor or capacitor is just ridiculous.

My suggestion is the find a breadboard the is as smooth as butter to connect to and never stray from it. Surprisingly enough, I find Radio Shack breadboards to have very nice connection terminals that require no break-in.

###How to Fix It
If you do have a breadboard that has overly tight terminals there is an easy way to fix it although it does take a little time. Simply grab a pair of pliers and a length of male header (4 to 5 pins long). Grab the short side of the header pins firmly with the pliers and then push the header pins into the terminals. With a length of 5 pins you can handle an entire vertical row at a time. That's all there is to it. After doing this your components should slide easily and securely into your breadboard. Here's a vine showing the process.
