As part of my Skillshare class [Unleash The Raspberry Pi Through Physical Computing][skillshare] I created a cheat sheet that I reference when working on hardware projects involving the Pi. 

You may find it useful when working on your own projects so feel free to download and share. Let me know if you think I'm missing something important. I'm working on an HTML version and will update this post when it's ready.
