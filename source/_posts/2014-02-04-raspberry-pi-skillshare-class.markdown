**[UPDATE]:** After a lot of thought I've decided to release the class for free.  You can still use the link below but the cost is now $0. I would greatly appreciate any feedback on the course because I want it to be as useful as possible.

My class [Unleash The Raspberry Pi Through Physical Computing][classlink] is now available on Skillshare. The class covers the 3 main hardware capabilities exposed by the GPIO header on the Pi:

  *  Digital I/O
  *  SPI
  *  I2C

<h1 style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/completed_clean_light_angle.jpg" alt="Simple Home Monitor with Raspberry Pi"/></h1>

In addition to covering each of these topics I also show you how to get your Raspberry Pi connected to Twitter. It's the first class on Skillshare to cover the Raspberry Pi and contains just **over 3 hours of video instruction**. It's packed with tips and tricks for creating your own hardware projects and students that enroll get access to a cheat sheet I've put together for creating hardware projects with the Raspberry Pi. If you'd like to enroll use the link at the top of this post to **get 50% off** and get the class for only $12.50 USD.
