Normally the first thing you'd want to do on a project is prototype out a design on a breadboard. Seeing that we are using a design somebody else has tested we are going to skip that this time. **Note: Exercise extreme caution when blindly accepting somebody else's design.** For a small project like this I think we'll be ok. The audio mixer we're going to build is based off of an [Instructables Project][project] that nicely defines the list of parts we'll need.

  -  3.5mm audio jacks
  -  4.7k resistors
  -  Case

Pretty simple except we don't want to buy our stuff from Radio Shack. The Shack can be very convenient but you are definitely paying for that convenience. We can get parts much cheaper online and we have access to a much wider selection. So where do we start? It depends on what part of the world you are shopping from but for those in the US I'd recommend one of three sites:

  -  [Mouser][mouser]
  -  [Digikey][digikey]
  -  [Newark][newark]

Prices can vary slightly between the 3 but I find Mouser and Newark to be easier to use than Digikey. 

Once you've decided where you are going to shop it's time to pick our parts. This can be daunting since, unlike the Radio Shack, you are facing literally thousands of options for something as simple as a 4.7k resistor. This can be scary at first but once you get the hang of it you'll find shopping at a major distributor to be very powerful. I felt the best way to walk through the process of finding parts was via a short video.

And that's it. We place our order and wait a few days. I've decided to stick with an Altoids tin as the case for this project although I'll probably slap a coat of paint on it. Now that we've selected our parts it's time to move into the assembly phase.
